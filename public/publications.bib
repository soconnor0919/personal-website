   abstract = {Human-robot interaction (HRI) research plays a pivotal role in shaping how robots communicate and collaborate with humans. However, conducting HRI studies, particularly those employing the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) technique, can be challenging. WoZ user studies can have complexities at the technical and methodological levels that may render the results irreproducible. We propose to address these challenges with HRIStudio, a novel web-based platform designed to streamline the design, execution, and analysis of WoZ experiments. HRIStudio offers an intuitive interface for experiment creation, real-time control and monitoring during experimental runs, and comprehensive data logging and playback tools for analysis and reproducibility. By lowering technical barriers, promoting collaboration, and offering methodological guidelines, HRIStudio aims to make human-centered robotics research easier, and at the same time, empower researchers to develop scientifically rigorous user studies.},
