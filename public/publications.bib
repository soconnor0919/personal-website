  abstract = {Human-robot interaction (HRI) research plays a pivotal role in shaping how robots communicate and collaborate with humans. However, conducting HRI studies can be challenging, particularly those employing the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) technique. WoZ user studies can have technical and methodological complexities that may render the results irreproducible. We propose to address these challenges with HRIStudio, a modular web-based platform designed to streamline the design, the execution, and the analysis of WoZ experiments. HRIStudio offers an intuitive interface for experiment creation, real-time control and monitoring during experimental runs, and comprehensive data logging and playback tools for analysis and reproducibility. By lowering technical barriers, promoting collaboration, and offering methodological guidelines, HRIStudio aims to make human-centered robotics research easier and empower researchers to develop scientifically rigorous user studies.},
