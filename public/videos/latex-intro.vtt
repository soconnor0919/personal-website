00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.600
Hello, and welcome to getting started

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.960
with LaTeX. This tutorial will walk you

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.160
through creating your first document

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.800
using the LaTeX

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.719
system. Alright, so what is LaTeX? LaTeX

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.680
is a typesetting system commonly used

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.640
for technical and scientific

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.640
documents. It's widely used throughout

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.199
the world of academia specifically in

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.600
engineering and science fields. This is

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.920
due to how easy LaTeX makes it for someone

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.960
to include complex mathematical

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.880
equations, models and more. Most documents

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
written in math or physics courses here

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.360
at Bucknell are written using

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
LaTeX. Throughout this tutorial we'll be

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.440
utilizing a free LaTeX editor called

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
Overleaf which is available online at

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.640
overleaf.com. All right, so let's set up

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.280
an editor. We'll start by going to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.800
Overleaf and signing in. If you don't

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.520
have an account, register using your

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.199
school provided Google

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.960
account. Once you see this page, click the

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.879
create a new project button and select

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.840
blank project. You'll be sent to the

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.000
Overleaf editor. This is where we'll be

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.479
working on our documents. The editor has

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.280
three main segments: the file selector,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.799
code editor, and preview pane. When

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.640
editing code, you'll need to hit the

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.439
recompile button to see changes on the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
preview

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.520
pane. Let's talk about some commonly used

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.840
tags. We begin with the title, author, and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.680
date tags. These specify important

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.479
information about the document and their

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520
specifics are

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.280
self-explanatory. Next we have the begin

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.000
tag which tells the compiler to start

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.520
building the document

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.600
itself. The make title tag tells the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.200
compiler to format and display the title

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.880
information including the author and the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.479
date. The section tag signifies the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.159
beginning of a section and produces a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.920
numbered section heading.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.520
Next we'll talk about tags that can be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.200
used to format text. The textbf tag

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.759
makes text appear bold. The textit tag

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.360
makes text appear

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.799
italicized. The underline tag makes text

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.880
appear underlined. The emph tag emphasizes a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.520
specific block of text. The appearance of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.360
this effect depends on the situation. If

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.879
the text being emphasized is within a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.080
block of standard text, it will be

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.000
italicized. Otherwise, if that selected

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.959
text block is within other italicized

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.920
text, it will be

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.760
de-italicized. These effects can be

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.080
combined within the same line. For

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.720
example, this line of code will italicize

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.440
the selected text as well as keep the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440
surrounding text

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.720
bold. Next we'll talk about displaying

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.720
math within a LaTeX document. Math

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.440
equations can be displayed in two modes:

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.200
inline mode and display mode.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.360
Starting with inline mode, we use the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.000
begin math and end math tags to specify

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.239
where an equation is written. This method

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.840
places an equation inline, meaning that

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.519
it will wrap as if it was part of the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.120
paragraph, blending with the surrounding

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.120
text. On the other hand, we can use

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.040
display mode which uses the begin

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.840
equation and end equation tags to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.519
distinguish equations from text.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.640
This will display math as if it's its

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.480
own line in a paragraph and can be used

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.640
to separate equations from the rest of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.640
the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.000
text. Now we'll put it all together.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.319
Here's an example of a document, this one

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.239
being the script for this video. Notice

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.800
how the title, author, and date tags are

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.879
used as well as the section headers. The

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280
title, author, and date are formatted in

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.640
the center of the page

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.120
automatically with text sizes being

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.640
decided by the compiler. The section

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.879
headings are automatically numbered and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.599
bolded and create coherent paragraphs

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.680
with minimal effort. As you can see, the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.360
LaTeX system allows for an author to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.599
create a document without focusing on

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.519
its formatting as one would see with

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.080
other what-you-see-is-what-you-get

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.040
editors such as Microsoft Word or Google

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.200
Docs. Instead, the author can focus on the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.360
content knowing that the content will be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.599
presented in a coherent way that makes

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.599
sense to the reader. When you're done

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.400
writing the document or making any edits

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.319
to it, you can click the recompile button

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.799
and that will display a preview in the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.959
preview pane. When you want to download

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.959
or export the document, click the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.920
download button next to the recompile

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.160
button. That will export a PDF file and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.400
send it to your downloads

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.080
folder. And that's it! Congratulations,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.160
you've just finished your first LaTeX

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.320
document. I hope you've been able to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.400
learn from this video and you'll be able

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.919
to recreate a LaTeX document whenever

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.919
you need. Thank you for watching.
