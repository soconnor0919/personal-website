00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello, and welcome to getting started

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
with LaTeX. This tutorial will walk you

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,160
through creating your first document

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,800
using the LaTeX

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,719
system. Alright, so what is LaTeX? LaTeX

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,680
is a typesetting system commonly used

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
for technical and scientific

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,640
documents. It's widely used throughout

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,199
the world of academia specifically in

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,600
engineering and science fields. This is

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,920
due to how easy LaTeX makes it for someone

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,960
to include complex mathematical

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
equations, models and more. Most documents

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
written in math or physics courses here

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,360
at Bucknell are written using

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,360
LaTeX. Throughout this tutorial we'll be

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,440
utilizing a free LaTeX editor called

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
Overleaf which is available online at

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,640
overleaf.com. All right, so let's set up

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,280
an editor. We'll start by going to

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
Overleaf and signing in. If you don't

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,520
have an account, register using your

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,199
school provided Google

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,960
account. Once you see this page, click the

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
create a new project button and select

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
blank project. You'll be sent to the

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,000
Overleaf editor. This is where we'll be

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
working on our documents. The editor has

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
three main segments: the file selector,

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,799
code editor, and preview pane. When

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
editing code, you'll need to hit the

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,439
recompile button to see changes on the

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
preview

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,520
pane. Let's talk about some commonly used

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,840
tags. We begin with the title, author, and

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
date tags. These specify important

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,479
information about the document and their

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
specifics are

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,280
self-explanatory. Next we have the begin

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,000
tag which tells the compiler to start

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,520
building the document

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,600
itself. The make title tag tells the

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,200
compiler to format and display the title

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,880
information including the author and the

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,479
date. The section tag signifies the

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,159
beginning of a section and produces a

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
numbered section heading.

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,520
Next we'll talk about tags that can be

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,200
used to format text. The textbf tag

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,759
makes text appear bold. The textit tag

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,360
makes text appear

52
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,799
italicized. The underline tag makes text

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,880
appear underlined. The emph tag emphasizes a

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,520
specific block of text. The appearance of

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,360
this effect depends on the situation. If

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
the text being emphasized is within a

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
block of standard text, it will be

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,000
italicized. Otherwise, if that selected

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,959
text block is within other italicized

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
text, it will be

61
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,760
de-italicized. These effects can be

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,080
combined within the same line. For

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,720
example, this line of code will italicize

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,440
the selected text as well as keep the

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,440
surrounding text

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,720
bold. Next we'll talk about displaying

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,720
math within a LaTeX document. Math

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,440
equations can be displayed in two modes:

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,200
inline mode and display mode.

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
Starting with inline mode, we use the

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
begin math and end math tags to specify

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,239
where an equation is written. This method

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
places an equation inline, meaning that

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,519
it will wrap as if it was part of the

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,120
paragraph, blending with the surrounding

76
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,120
text. On the other hand, we can use

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
display mode which uses the begin

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,840
equation and end equation tags to

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,519
distinguish equations from text.

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
This will display math as if it's its

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
own line in a paragraph and can be used

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
to separate equations from the rest of

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
the

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,000
text. Now we'll put it all together.

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,319
Here's an example of a document, this one

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
being the script for this video. Notice

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,800
how the title, author, and date tags are

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,879
used as well as the section headers. The

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,280
title, author, and date are formatted in

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,640
the center of the page

91
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,120
automatically with text sizes being

92
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,640
decided by the compiler. The section

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
headings are automatically numbered and

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,599
bolded and create coherent paragraphs

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
with minimal effort. As you can see, the

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,360
LaTeX system allows for an author to

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,599
create a document without focusing on

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
its formatting as one would see with

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
other what-you-see-is-what-you-get

100
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,040
editors such as Microsoft Word or Google

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Docs. Instead, the author can focus on the

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
content knowing that the content will be

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,599
presented in a coherent way that makes

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
sense to the reader. When you're done

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,400
writing the document or making any edits

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
to it, you can click the recompile button

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,799
and that will display a preview in the

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,959
preview pane. When you want to download

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,959
or export the document, click the

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,920
download button next to the recompile

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,160
button. That will export a PDF file and

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,400
send it to your downloads

113
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,080
folder. And that's it! Congratulations,

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,160
you've just finished your first LaTeX

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,320
document. I hope you've been able to

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
learn from this video and you'll be able

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,919
to recreate a LaTeX document whenever

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,919
you need. Thank you for watching.
