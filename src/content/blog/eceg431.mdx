## Assignment Prompt

An end-of-course reflection activity that is both

1. intended to prepare for the after-action review during the final exam period, and
2. a chance for you to reflect on what happened in the course.

Before starting this, take some time to read back through your reflections on gradescope. Think through your own journey through the course. You must include specific quotes from your earlier reflections in your answers to these prompts, as well as artifacts such as code or screenshots of your programs. Remember to also look at your reading reflections as well as project reflections and also any responses I may have given back to you.

## The Call

The story begins ... where it begins. A downtrodden situation? A rough situation? But something prompts you to seek a change of status.

> Aladdin goes about his life as usual, but then saves someone- and learns they are royalty! He then decides to set out to make something of his self (and maybe win a princess's heart).

What made you originally interested in this class? Or maybe, after hearing about things on the first week, what was it that really got you excited?

I wanted to know what happens inside the "black box". I had the theory from discrete math (MATH 241) and computer systems (CSCI 306), but I wanted to see it actually work.

> The idea of building a complete product from fundamentals was exciting.

— Reading 1 Reflection

My initial thought was, "Building a product from fundamentals? Sign me up." But the reality was that [Project 1](https://github.com/soconnor0919/eceg431/tree/main/01) felt like a victory lap. `And`, `Or`, `Xor`- I'd done this before on paper. Implementing them in HDL was just a formality. I mean, look at this "code" for Xor. It's just wiring.

```hdl
// projects/01/Xor.hdl
// a and not b path
And(a=a, b=notB, out=aPath);
// not a and b path
And(a=notA, b=b, out=bPath);
// combine both paths
Or(a=aPath, b=bPath, out=out);
```

## Getting out in the world and Initial successes

You set out to better yourself. And you're able to make some gains in this quest for success! Or at least, it has the appearance of making inroads...

> Aha! Aladdin finds a magic lamp! With a wish he can transform himself to be Prince Ali Ababwa, granting him access to the royal court!

As you started to get out into the course, things were generally going well. You were really making some progress. What were those initial successes? What made you feel good and helped you really start to see things connecting? In those early days of the course, where was it you were thinking you'd end up?

I was cruising- absolutely cruising. The ALU and RAM ([Project 3](https://github.com/soconnor0919/eceg431/tree/main/03)) were logical extensions of the logic gates. Even the Program Counter was just a series of Muxes. I'm comfortable in the terminal, I know my way around a text editor. I thought, "If the whole class is just wrapping logic gates in different ways, I've got this."

```hdl
// projects/03/a/PC.hdl
// choose current or inc'd val (based on inc)
Mux16(a=regOut, b=incOut, sel=inc, out=postInc);
// choose ^ vs input (based on load)
Mux16(a=postInc, b=in, sel=load, out=postLoad);
```

> Project 1 was easy due to prior knowledge... I was cruising.

— Project 1 Reflection

## Central Crisis

The "oh crap" moment. A dark figure from the past comes to haunt you; a love is lost; the facade of success begins to crumble. The victories you've gained seem to slip away, and crushed, you are at your low point.

> Aladdin decides to continue his ruse as Prince Ali so that the marriage to the princess can be lawful. But the Royal Vizier Jafar exposes Aladdin's true identity.

For the course, this could be lots of things. Work piling up? Concepts getting hard? Confusion setting in? Difficulty asking for help? Reliance on LLMs piling on? Not coming to class? Or maybe something entirely external to the course. What was it for you? There seems to be a common theme that happens to all of us in this course---we set out strong, start doing well with big dreams, but we typically all go through something and our original plans for the course start to crumble. What were those moments for you?

**[Project 5: The CPU](https://github.com/soconnor0919/eceg431/blob/main/05/CPU.hdl)**. This is where the "just wrapping logic gates" theory fell apart. It wasn't just logic anymore; it was _timing_. It was _control_. Decoding instructions was fine, but managing the control flow was a nightmare.

```hdl
// projects/05/CPU.hdl
// decode instruction type
Not(in=instruction[15], out=aInstr); // aInstr = 1 when instruction[15] = 0
Not(in=aInstr, out=cInstr); // cInstr = 1 when instruction[15] = 1

// pick A reg input (instruction or ALU out)
Mux16(a=instruction, b=aluOut, sel=cInstr, out=aRegIn);
```

As I wrote in my reflection: _"The problem was taking the instruction and turning it into something the ALU could handle... I just repeatedly hit my head against a wall."_ (Project 5 Reflection). The fix wasn't more code. I had to stop coding and start drawing. I couldn't "hack" my way through a hardware definition. I had to understand the signals.

> There are three steps to solving a problem. Write down what you know, Think really hard, Write down the answer. You're at step 2.

— Ned Ladd (in my head during Project 5)

## Independence and Ordeal

You find yourself back where you started. Or are you? You still have your traits, skills, abilities, knowledge and can overcome the problem! Don't dwell in the low point! The character really begins to realize their own independence and prove to the haters they can reach the goal. The final confrontation takes place!

> Aladdin is back on the streets, the magic lamp is gone, and Jafar seems poised to rule the kingdom. But Aladdin knows a thing or two. He sneaks back to the castle, uses his wits, and is able to trick Jafar and imprison him.

You might still be more in the midst of this part of the ordeal. Or maybe you are just now realizing your independence and seeing how much you've gained and have been able to overcome. What worked for you? This could also be a story of you struggling through the crisis, moving on and really started to piece together some big questions you had about how computing works. How did your story and journey through this course go? What were your big connective moments, or the big challenge you worked through?

**Modularity.**

**[Snake Game](https://github.com/soconnor0919/eceg431/tree/main/09/Snake)** was where I finally felt like I was writing software again, but Jack is... painful. No built-in random functions? Seriously? I had to find a random number generator online using "Linear Congruential Generator" math that I didn't really understand, just to spawn food. And don't get me started on the lack of color support.

But instead of a monolithic mess, I built it like a real software project. You can see this structure in my game controller, which composes the objects rather than managing raw state:

```jack
// projects/09/Snake/SnakeGame.jack
class SnakeGame {
    field Snake snake;
    field Food food;
    // ...
    constructor SnakeGame new() {
        let snake = Snake.new();
        let food = Food.new();
        do food.spawn(); // spawn food at random position
```

> The modular design approach I'd been using in Projects 6-8 carried over well - separate classes for Point, Food, Snake, and SnakeGame made the code clean and easy to debug.

— Project 9 Reflection

This approach carried me through the Assembler and Compiler. Break it down, solve the small piece, move on.

## Final Union, Completion, and Fulfillment

You made it! And for real this time. It's the happily-ever-after moment where the hero recognizes they've reached or exceeded their goals. And it sticks. The reward is yours to claim.

> The sultan is grateful to Aladdin for saving their country and changes the marriage rules to not require marrying royalty. Aladdin is welcomed into the royal family and Aladdin and Jasmine live happily ever after.

For you in the course, maybe you're not there. Maybe you still have some battles to fight. However, the course itself is done. Think through though, and really see what you've picked up and learn. What parts of "computing" now make more sense? What have you learned about yourself? Do you feel more knowledgeable or prepared for some things? It's your story! Tell it!

It finally clicked during the Compiler project ([Project 10/11](https://github.com/soconnor0919/eceg431/tree/main/10)). I was writing a compiler (in Python) that outputs VM code. Seeing the high-level logic translate directly to VM commands was the "glass box" moment:

```python
# projects/11/hjc.py
def compileIf(self):
    # ...
    # Jump to true branch if condition is true
    self.vmWriter.writeIf(trueLabel)
    self.vmWriter.writeGoto(falseLabel)
    self.vmWriter.writeLabel(trueLabel)
```

It translates to Assembly, which runs on the CPU I struggled with, composed of the NAND gates I breezed through. The "magic" is gone. It's just layers of abstraction all the way down. Even the "OS" we built is generous naming—it's really just a standard library.

> Calling this an 'OS' is generous- it's really just a std lib (Math, String, Array) without the kernel overhead.

— Reading 12 Reflection

But the result is that I can look at code now and see the stack frame, the program counter, and the binary signals. It's not a black box anymore; it's a glass box. I built it, so I know exactly where the cracks are.
